# Image Prompting Research

## Objective
Research and document best practices for achieving optimal results with text to image prompting when using diffusion models like midjourney and flux. Write actual prompts people can use right away, write 10
text to image prompt focusing on achieving non-AI look, new visual design language, production design, color grading, art directing that can could be used in movie production. stay away from the typical ai look and hollywood cliches. avoid using cinematic cliches and overused tricks. find out something new, a new visual language how you put humans in a scene

## Research Areas


## Methodology
Using SPARC CLI in research-only mode to:
- first you need to understand how cinematic coloring, color grading, art direction, photography and production design works and how it becomes signature to series like breaking bad, severance. the color usage, color palette, angles, film stock, lighting, etc
- without copying these series, write made up scenes featuring remarkable product design and coloring, find out never before seen, unique color combinations, lighting, compostions etc that could be a base for a new series. you can go to extremes
- continue going even deeper, do not follow your dataset and typical movie industry cliches, but combine the most unusal stuff from all over the human knowledge
- avoid AI generated look, in any circumstances
- let's focus on a scene with 2 people in a room or outdoors. variate the time of day, room background, lighting, composition, angles, color grading, film stock, color palette, production design, actors. do not follow the typical cliches, go deep, be experimental 
- the background, clothing, scene can be natural, real life, focus on the unique visual, unique character design rather than playing with the typical ai lights and colors
- think about movies how they use everyday visual tools in a signature and unique innovative way like twin peaks, wes anderson, severance, breaking bad. give the viewer something fresh
- in summary, what do you need to give viewers a unique experience in movies.
- be experimental and focus on interesting, new visual language, demonstrate humans how they should see the world around them differently, notice  other things they would not normally, as david lynch and similar directors tried to show. outside of their comfort zone, still entertaining
